### Setting up a simulation

Before creating a .dat and .pgm file, a directory corresponding to the simulation should first be created.
In this directory the .dat and .pgm file should be saved. The output of the simulation will be stored in this directory as well.

### The .dat file

The .dat file (ideally) contains all the parameters **FLUIDchem** needs to produce results. An example of how this could look would be:

The possible parameters can be seen in the `example.dat`.

### The .pgm file

The .pgm file contains geometric information needed for the simulation. An example of how this could look would be:
